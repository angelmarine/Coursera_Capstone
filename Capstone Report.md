# Capstone Report

## Introduction

Market research is an important prerequisite for starting a business. 
Market research often involving investigating the need of the market and the current status of the market such as saturation level and potential competitors. 
Highly saturated market would not be a suitable target for starting a business, as it would lead to high competition and high expectations of customers.
And it is applicable for restaurants as well, because having many restaurants that serves the same kind of dishes would only lead to high competitions and 
high customer expectations. Therfore, it is important to target a market niche, which is to provide differentiated dishes.
The goal of this project is to do some market research for starting a restaurant at an area of interest, in order to recommend potential market niche.

## Data

Data involved in the project would be mainly Foursquare location data, which would be used to investigate the different kinds of restaurants
available in the area of interest. The data will also be used to generate and categorize possible restaurant types.
